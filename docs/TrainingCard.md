## Employee View

We're going to take a look at the Roster Manager by Employee screen.

Helpful for Day-to-day tasks, but also Publication processes.

Quick look at the general usage, then come back to Publishing.

### General Usage

- Navigation & Filters
- Drag & Drop Demo
	- Assign - Maria Monday
	- Unassign 
- Force Error - Drag and Drop Maria to Tuesday
- Preferred Settings
- Re-assign, fix Maria hours
- Add shift with employee
- Add shift without employee - Autofill & Search
- Pin, Name Filter
- Break Rule - Tom Castle
- Override via Edit
- Remove again
- Fill Assist

### Publishing

Demo of Roster Manager screen issues

- Cant see employee hours - either current or incorrect
- Exception - still only shows error

  

Mostly static - might be enough to run as a final check
More varied - may still need more work


### Employee View Publishing

- Filter Out
    - Assigned - see people accidentally left off roster - casuals, other departments, "just in case" associations
    - Unassigned - see only people actually working here - clears up space
- Sort by remaining hours when "mostly done"
- Publish
- Unpublished


# Communications

> [!NOTE] 
> - All can be done in RM. RMEV preferred because of additional flexibility.
> - Specific Scenarios covered here, starting off with single employee, then multiple employees.
> - No need to remember roster codes - will show where to find later.
> - Can be done as SMS or Push. > - When push is enabled, SMS is still the failover. 
> - From senders perspective, no change. 
> - Will focus on SMS here. Will demo PN in overview demo.
